# Project Title

Neural machine translation with attention

## Description
We will train a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model for Spanish to English translation.

After training the model, anyone will be able to input a Spanish sentence, such as "Â¿todavia estan en casa?", and return the English translation: "are you still at home?"
